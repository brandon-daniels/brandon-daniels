ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Brandon M. Daniels, a PhD Candidate in Communication at the University of Colorado Boulder. I have a background in the academic humanities, but I tinker, hack, and investigate with computers. I use computational methods to investigate human language use, interpret trends and patterns, and communicate findings in a clear and effective manner. I'm proficient in python and established practices of statistical inferencing and data vizualization. I use natural language processing techniques to understand textual datasets ranging from small and curated corpora to unstructured social media data.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in cultural analytics, natural language processing, and the digital humanities.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning R, TensorFlow, Keras.

This essay was developed out of a collaborative digital humanities project that created a plain-text-corpus of the Chicano student newspaper _El Diario De La Gente_. In this essay, my co-author and I use the corpus to test our ability to measure the linguistic similarity between an influential poem and the collection of creative student writing.
